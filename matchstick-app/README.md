This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

# Installing npm and React Using Terminal/Shell

You can install **Node.js** (which includes npm) and set up a **React** app entirely using your terminal or shell. Below are the steps for **macOS** and **Windows**.

---

## **Installing Node.js and npm**

### **macOS (using Homebrew):**
1. If you don’t have Homebrew installed, install it first:
   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

2.	Install Node.js using Homebrew:
   ```
    brew install node
   ```

### Windows (using Chocolatey):

Install Chocolatey if you don’t have it.
Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:

 ```
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
```
## **Running app on local host**

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
